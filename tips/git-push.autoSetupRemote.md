# How to Use the `push.autoSetupRemote` Feature in Git

*Disclaimer: This article was generated by an AI language model ChatGPT*

The `push.autoSetupRemote` feature in Git makes it easy to push your changes to a default remote branch without having to specify the remote and branch names each time you push.

For example, let's say you're working on a short-lived feature branch and you want to push your changes to the remote repository for submiting PR. 
Normally, you would need to specify the remote branch name each time you push, like this:

```
git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch
```

With `push.autoSetupRemote` enabled, you can simply run `git push` and Git will automatically push your changes to the default upstream branch.

## Here are the TLDR; ðŸ‘€

To enable this feature, simply run the following command in your Git repository:

```
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote always
```

Once enabled, you can now push your changes using the following command:

```
git push
```

Time saved ðŸ˜Ž.

Git will automatically determine the remote and branch to push to based on the current branch you're on and the default upstream branch.

If you want to disable this feature, you can run the following command:

```
git config --global push.autoSetupRemote never
```

Happy coding!
