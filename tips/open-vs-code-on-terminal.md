In case you are not a lover of `vim` / `nano` in shell, you can try installing VS Code code cli.

* In your VS Code editor,
* press `Command` + `Shift` + `P` to open the command bar,
* search and run this command:
  ```shell
  Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH 
  ```
---

Then you can open file with VS Code in terminal like this:
```shell
code path/to/file
```

Enjoy!
