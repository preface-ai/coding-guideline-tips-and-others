# Terminology

## Trunk branch
  * the main branch of the repository
  * in Github, it should be the default branch and it normally named as `main`
  * for legacy issue, the trunk branch of following repository have different naming:
    * https://github.com/preface-ai/preface-website-frontend
      * Trunk branch `develop`
    * https://github.com/preface-ai/preface-nomad-b
      * Trunk branch `development`

# Suggested Git Development Workflow

## Make sure your local trunk branch is in sync with remote
* Make sure you are at the trunk branch first
  ```bash
    git checkout main
    # please replace main with develop or development accordingly if you work on specific repository
  ```
* pull the latest code from remote
  ```bash
    git pull
  ```
* ‚≠êÔ∏è Advance Tips:
  * If you know git well enough, you can create and checkout your feature branch from latest remote `main` branch driectly without touching your local `main` branch
  * Feel free to do it in alternative way if you know exactly what you are doing.

## Create & Checkout a new feature branch

* run this
  ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-branch-name
  ```
  * please replace `your-feature-branch-name` with your target feature branch naming
  * make sure the branch name is unique and easy to understand.

## Work on your code change on the feature branch

* Try to split your task into multiple milestone and focus on single milestone each time
* when current milestone is complete, feel free to commit your code change in your local
* you can have as many commits as you want because at the end they will become a single squashed commit after merge via Pull Request

## Push your local feature branch to remote

* When you finish all your milestone of the task, you can run following to push all of your commit in local feature branch to remote
  ```bash
    git push --set-upstream origin your-feature-branch-name
  ```
* or, you can just run `git push`, it will not work but hint you with the above command
* If you already bind your local feature branch with the remote but you still want to commit new change:
  * you can still do it and push the change to remote again via `git push`

## Submit a Pull Request(PR) to trunk branch
* After you feature branch get push to remote, you should be able to find your branch on github
* You can than create a pull request from your branch to the trunk `main`
* Make sure you provide:
  * Meaningful title of the Pull request. Suggest include Clickup ID if the task is related to a Clickup ticket
  * Briefly explain what & why this PR is for, if the repository you are working on have a pull request template, make sure to follow it.
  * Annotate yourself as the assignee

## Request Code review & update your code based on feedback

* Annotate your code reviewer in the Pull Request
* Please send the link of this PR to your targeted Code Reviewer via our Slack Channel `team-tech`
* Wait until your coder reviewer have left you feedback of the code(async-ly in the PR, or provided face-to-face)
* Based on the feedback, if you need further code change, you can keep working on the same branch on your local and commit it.
* You code changes will be reflected in the same PR after you `git push` it againüëçüèª

## üèÅ Squash & Merge your Pull request to Trunk branch 

* Once your Code reviewer approved your code change, you are free to merge this Pull request to the trunk branch
* Please make sure using `Squash & merge` option to do the merge.
